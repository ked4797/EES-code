for the display, if you want to change the colour, you can use a colour name prefaced by ST77XX - eg. ST77XX_BLACK
These are the colours that I know it will accept as they're used in the sample code, there are probably more:
- Black
- White
- Magenta
- Yellow 
- Green
- Red
- Blue
It takes the arguments for colours as a 16-bit unsigned integer, so their actual values must be stored somewhere, I just don't know where...
