# EES Code and Design Files Repository
Here you will find the code and other things that Hills Road Team 1 have developed over the course of EES 2020-2021. 'Test Code' contains the example code that was used when first running the components and microcontroller, and in 'Design Diagrams' there are copies of the schematic, PCB design and 3D models.
